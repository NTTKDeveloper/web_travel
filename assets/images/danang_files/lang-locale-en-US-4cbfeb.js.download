For example, if you make a claim for USD 1,000 and you have an excess of USD 250 from damages during your rental period, the insurance provider will deduct USD 250 from your claim and return the remaining USD 750 to you. Or if you have no excess, you will get back the entire USD 1,000. You can reduce excess charges by upgrading your insurance coverage directly at the rental store. You can find details of your insurance excess amounts on your booking details page.","30344":"Where can I find the details of my car rental\'s insurance coverage?","30345":"You can find the details of your car\'s insurance coverage on the booking details page or on your voucher.","30346":"What payment options are available?","30347":"Klook accepts most credit cards and some debit cards (specific payment options will be shown on the check out page). We strongly recommend to use a credit card in the same name as the lead driver. <br/><br/>If your booking is paid by someone other than the lead driver, you may need to present supplementary documents for security reasons. However, you don\'t have to use the same card to pay the deposit when you pick up your car. <br/><br/><span style=\\"font-weight:bold;\\">Important:</span> You need to present a valid credit card in the name of the lead driver to pre-authorize the deposit when you pick up your car. The credit card must be embossed and a PIN may be required. <br/><br/>If you can\'t present a valid credit card in the lead driver\'s name, or if there are not enough funds on the card, the rental company may refuse to release the car. In these instances, no refunds can be made.","30348":"What is the cancellation policy?","30349":"Cancellation policies usually differ depending on the car rental company. You can find the specific policies listed in the Terms & Conditions of your booking.<br/><br/>In most cases, you will receive a full refund as long as you cancel the booking before pick up. Some suppliers may also offer free cancellation up to a certain hour before pick up. If you cancel past the free cancellation period, you may receive a partial refund or no refund at all. If you cancel after your rental is due to start or you are unable to pick up the car (usually counted as a \\"no-show\\"), no refunds will be given.<br/><br/>Car rental companies count it as a \\"no-show\\" when you do not pick up the car for reasons including: not arriving at the arranged date and time, not presenting the correct documents, not being eligible for the rental, or the main driver does not have a credit card with enough credit for the deposit.","30350":"What is the \\"no-show\\" policy?","30351":"A \\"no-show\\" is counted for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1) The car rental company wasn\'t informed of your cancellation before your pick up time<br/>2) The car was not picked up at the arranged date and time<br/>3) The proper documentation required to pick up the car was not presented<br/>4) A credit card in the lead driver\'s name was not presented or does not have enough available funds.<br/><br/>No refunds can be made if any of the events above are met. The car rental company reserves the right to refuse any customer who fails to arrive on time, without all necessary documentation or a credit card with enough available funds for the security deposit. In such cases, unless the booking has been cancelled in advance, the customer will not be entitled to a refund.","30352":"Can I pick up my car at one location and return it at a different location?","30353":"Yes, you can pick up your car in one place and drop it off in another, subject to a one-way fee. If the one-way fee is not already included in the rental price displayed, it will be charged as an additional cost upon check out. Upon pick up, please inform the car rental company directly if you want to drop off the car at a different location. You will find the company\'s phone number on your Klook voucher or the rental agreement signed upon pick up.","30354":"Why do I need to add my flight details?","30355":"By providing your flight number, the car rental agent at the pick up location can be informed of your arrival time and can keep your reservation in case of any delays. Please also contact the car rental company if there are any anticipated flight delays.","30356":"What if I want to pick up or drop off my rental car outside office hours?","30357":"If you enter the exact time you would like to pick up or return the car when you search on Klook, we\'ll only show the cars that are available within the time you need. Please note that extra charges may apply for out-of-hours service in some locations.","30358":"How do I add and pay for an additional driver?","30359":"Some suppliers may have special offers to include an additional driver for free, but the option to manually add a driver by online booking is not currently available. You will need to register and pay for additional drivers directly at the car rental company when you pick up your car. All age and license requirements will apply.","30360":"What is a fuel policy?","30361":"The fuel policy explains how the car will be re-fueled during your rental period. Some cars require a \'full to full\' fuel policy, meaning the tank will be full when you pick up the car and must be returned full after use. You can find the specific fuel policy in the car\'s description before booking.","30362":"What currency should I use to pay?","30363":"If you choose the \\"Pay now\\" option, you can pay with any currency available on Klook (note that exchange rates may vary). If you choose \\"Pay upon pick up\\", the currency will depend on the car\'s pick-up location. For example, if you pick up the car in Taiwan, you\'ll pay in TWD. If you pick up the car in Korea, you\'ll pay in KRW.","30364":"Can I reserve a specific brand, model or color of car?","30365":"You can reserve your preferred model if there is a \'model guaranteed\' label on the car\'s description. Otherwise, the cars displayed on the website are just examples. The exact make, model or color of the car you receive will depend on the availability of the supplier\'s fleet on your pick up date. However, you will be able to choose the car type, seating capacity, transmission, and trunk space.","30366":"What additional charges may apply to my booking?","30367":"Each car rental company has its own policies on additional charges, which will be clearly stated in the rental conditions when booking. Generally, additional charges may apply for the following reasons: pick up and drop off outside service hours, border crossing, one-way fees, driver age fees and winterisation fees, among others. Additional charges need to be paid in the local currency upon rental pick up.","30368":"What are the age requirements for renting a car?","30369":"Each car rental company has its own age requirements, but most will rent to customers aged 25-65. Customers aged 21-25 may need to pay a \'risk driving fee\'. For more specific information, you can refer to the Terms & Conditions listed on the car details page.","30370":"Is there a mileage limit for car rentals?","30371":"Most cars do not have mileage restrictions. If there are any, we\'ll make sure to list them on the search results page.","30372":"Will the deposit be held or directly deducted on my credit card?","30373":"Deposits are generally held in the form of pre-authorization, but some car rental companies may directly deduct it in the form of consumption. When you pick up your car, you will receive an SMS notification that will specify whether the deposit is pre-authorized or consumable. We also recommend calling your card\'s issuing bank to confirm.","30374":"What do I need to bring when picking up the car?","30375":"You\'ll need to present the following:<br/><br/>1) Driver\'s license that must have been help for at least 1-2 years depending on the car rental company\'s policy (applicable to lead drivers and any additional drivers). Licenses must be written in English characters, otherwise you need to present an international driving permit along with your original license.<br/>2) Valid credit card in the name of the lead driver, with enough funds to pre-authorize or charge the required deposit<br/>3) Valid photo ID (e.g. passport, national ID, etc.)<br/>4) Printed voucher (failure to present a printed voucher may result in additional charges)<br/><br/>For more information on specific requirements of the different suppliers, you can refer to the Terms & Conditions on the car detail page.","30376":"Will I have to leave a deposit when I pick up my car?","30377":"The car rental company usually charges a deposit in case the car is damaged or stolen during your rental. The deposit amount will be temporarily held or deducted from the lead driver\'s credit card during the rental period. As long as the car is not damaged at the end of your rental, the deposit will be returned within 30-60 days depending on your bank.<br/><br/><span style=\\"font-weight:bold;\\">Important:</span> If the lead driver\'s card does not have enough funds for the deposit, you will not be allowed to take the car, or the staff may insist for you to buy additional insurance. This is a standard practice with all car rental companies. Deposit policies are subject to the details on your voucher.","30378":"What if I get a fine or a ticket while driving the rental car?","30379":"You are responsible for any fines or tickets issued during your rental period. Please inform the staff at the end of your rental if violations were made so they may help you settle the corresponding payments. The car rental company may charge an administrative fee to your credit card, along with any fines or ticket costs.","30380":"What should I do if I get into an accident during my rental period?","30381":"You must first obtain an accident report issued and signed by the police department, and detailed information of the third party involved in the accident.<br/><br/>For major accidents (e.g. the vehicle can no longer be driven), the car rental company will send a replacement car. For minor accidents, the car rental company will charge the corresponding repair cost at the end of you rental period.<br/><br/>Upon returning the car, please present the accident report issued by the police, and fill in the car rental company\'s accident or car damage report. Depending on the insurance bought, you may need to pay for repair costs.<br/><br/>Please keep a copy of all rental documents for the reference of the insurance company and follow the proper procedure, otherwise your vehicle insurance may become invalid and you will not be eligible for any compensation. Please make sure to sign the check-in form when returning your vehicle. Failure to do so may cause delays in the investigation of damages.","30382":"Do I have to return the vehicle at the exact time arranged?","30383":"Under normal circumstances, you can return the car within half an hour after the specified return time. Beyond that, the car rental company will charge you any corresponding insurance and car rental fees in accordance with company policies. Please note that rates may change without prior notice. We recommend to plan your schedule ahead and return the vehicle on time to avoid any additional charges.","30384":"If I return the car early, can the rental cost be partially refunded?","30385":"The rental cost is strictly calculated according to the pick up and return time shown on your voucher. There are no refunds for unused time.","30386":"Why is my credit card still being charged after I returned the car?","30387":"Generally, your credit card may be charged after your rental period for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1) If you have any traffic violations, the car rental company will deduct the corresponding fines and any administrative fees<br/>2) If you got into an accident and the insurance you bought does not cover the whole repair cost, the car rental company will deduct the balance that is not covered by the insurance company<br/><br/>Please make sure to read the rental agreement carefully when you pick up your car.","30388":"(ì£¼)ë¬´ì§ê°ë í¸ì¹´ë¥¼ ì°¾ìì£¼ìì ëë¨í ê°ì¬í©ëë¤. ì í¬ (ì£¼)ë¬´ì§ê°ë í¸ì¹´ë ìëê° ë í¸ì¹´ ìë¬´ì ì¢ì¬í ì ì ì¸ì¬ë¤ì´ ëª¨ì¬ì 2010ë 4ìì ë í¸ì¹´ ì¬ìì ììíê² ëììµëë¤. ìëê°ì ê²½íì ë°íì¼ë¡ ì ì£¼ë¥¼ ë°©ë¬¸íìë ëª¨ë  ë¶ë¤ê» ìµê³ ì ìë¹ì¤ì ìµê³ ì ë§ì¡±ì ëë¦¬ê¸° ìí´ ì  ì§ìì´ í­ì ìµì ì ë¤íê³  ììµëë¤. ì ì£¼ì¬íì ê¼­ íìí ì°¨ëì ì ì¬ì ìì ìí  í ê³µê¸ì ëª©ì ì¼ë¡ ì¸íì  ê·ëª¨ ë¿ë§ ìëë¼ ìë¹ì¤ììë ìµê³ ê° ëê¸° ìí ê³ ê°ê°ë ê²½ìì ì ì²íì¬, ê³ ê°ë§ì¡± 100%ë¥¼ ëª©íë¡ ëªì¤ìë¶í ìµê³ ì ìë¹ì¤ë¥¼ ê¿ê¾¸ë©° ì§ìì ì¸ ìë¹ì¤ ê²½ìë ¥ íë³´ì í¥ìì ì£¼ë ¥ íê³ ì í©ëë¤. ë¤ì ì°¾ê³  ì¶ì ì ì£¼, ë¤ì ì°¾ê³  ì¶ì ë í¸ì¹´, ì í¬ (ì£¼)ë¬´ì§ê°ë í¸ì¹´ ê° ìì¥ìê² ìµëë¤.","30431":"Subtotal","30470":"The ranking of activities is based on monthly page views, saves, bookings and reviews","30475":"You\'ll need to update your Klook app to the latest version to book","30518":"Join event","30519":"Looks like you haven\'t started any groups yet","30520":"Looks like you haven\'t joined any groups yet","30521":"My groups","30522":"Don\'t see the promo code in your account within 12 hours?
